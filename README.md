The project aims to develop a user-friendly Single Page Application (SPA) using AngularJS for the Bloom Care Hospital website. This SPA will consist of six primary pages: Login, Home, Contact Us, Payment, Doctors, about us, and Appointment. The Login page will provide secure authentication for users, ensuring data privacy. The Home page will serve as an informative hub, showcasing the hospital's services, facilities, and recent updates. On the Contact Us page, visitors can find contact information and a convenient form to reach out to the hospital. The Payment page will enable secure online transactions for services offered by the hospital, ensuring a seamless payment experience for patients
